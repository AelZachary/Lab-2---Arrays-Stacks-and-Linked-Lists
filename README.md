Working on the Daily Task Manager program was a good experience. I learned how to organize tasks using arrays, stacks, and linked lists, which was fun.
I learned that breaking work into smaller parts helps a lot. The program had different sections like the task list, undo stack, and linked list, making it easier to work on and fix problems.
The undo feature helped me understand how stacks work, like stacking plates. I used it to undo completed tasks, which made me see how stacks work in real life.
I used LinkedList for tasks that can change in size. Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, which is helpful when the number of tasks isnâ€™t fixed.
Adding ASCII art was a fun part. It made the program more interesting and gave me practice with formatting text.
This project helped me get better at solving problems. I learned how to store tasks, let users interact with the program, and make everything work smoothly.
I also learned that keeping the code simple and organized is important for easy future improvements.
Overall, this project helped me practice coding in a real scenario, and it made me think about how to organize and solve problems.
